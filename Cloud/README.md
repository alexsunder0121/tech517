## Intro to Cloud

### What is cloud computing?

• on-demand delivery of computing power, storage, applications and other IT resources

• Usually pay-as-you-go pricing


### How do we know if something is in the cloud? Differences between on-prem and the cloud?





### 4 deployment models of cloud: private vs public vs hybrid vs multi-cloud

•Public 
   
    • "multi-tenant cloud"
    
    • shared with public 
    
    • cloud services are owed and operated by a 3rd 
    party cloud service provider 
    
    • delivered over the internet 

•Private 
    
    • "single-tenant cloud"

    • dedicated to a private organisation

    • could be used when there's no internet access (e.g. cruise ship)

    • Advantages
            • security for sensitive apps/data 
            • complete control 
            • not exposed to the public 
            • may no way into from the outside 


•Hybrid 

    • usually mix of on-prem and public cloud 

    • control over sensitive assets by keeping them on-prem


•Multi-cloud
    
    • using a mix of cloud providers (e.g. AWS and Azure)


### Types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS




### What are the advantages/disadvantages of the cloud? (Particularly for a business)

Advantages

• Physical security 

• Dsposal of hard drives

• Ease to scale 

• Some services have redundancy built in

• In case of disaster, each data center has its own cooling, power and networking

Disadvantages

• Energy consumption 

• Cost management, auditing 

• Depending on type of service chosen, loss of control 

• Requires cloud expertise 

• Possibly more complex 

• Disaster at a data center? 



### Difference between OpEx vs CapEx and how it relates the cloud

• OpEx = Operating Expenditure 
        
        • On-going costs 

• CapEx = Capital Expenditure 
        
        • Upfront costs 

• On-prem is usually going to have more CapEx, but still have OpEx

• Using public cloud usually less capital expenditure 

### Is migrating to the cloud always cheaper?

• Depends on the organisation, their needs, their costs 

• 2 types of calculators
    
    • Pricing calculators - find out about the cost of any cloud service/product
    • Total Cost of Ownership(TCO) calculators- helps an organisation compare longterm costs of on-prem vs migrating to that cloud service 


### Guaranteed levels of service

• Most services have SLA (Service Level Agreement) which gurantees a certain level of service/uptime (e.g 99%)

### Marketshare - Who are the biggest cloud providers?

•


### Which cloud provider do you think might be the best?

• AWS
    
    • The largest cloud provider by market share. Offers a very wide range of services and was one of the earliest cloud platforms.

• Azure 

    • The second largest provider. Strongly integrated with Microsoft products and widely used in enterprise and public sector organisations.

• Google

    • The third largest provider. Known for strengths in data, analytics, and infrastructure efficiency.



### What sorts of things do you usually need to pay for when using the cloud?

• Computer power + RAM + Bandwidth amount 

• Storage 

• Traffic (OUT of the network, "egress")

• Anything in limited supply e.g. public IP addresses 



## Intro to AWS


* Global infrastructure is broken into regions e.g. London, Ireland etc. 
  
* Within each Region, it has sepreate data centers (Availability Zones) 
  
* Most regions, will have 3 AZs 
  
*
