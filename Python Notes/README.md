# Python Notes

This folder contains my Python learning notes and exercises completed during training.

## Topics Covered
- Control flow (if, elif, else)
- Loops (for and while)
- Functions
- Working with lists and strings
- Input validation
- Prime number logic
- Reusing functions across tasks

## Areas I Found Challenging
- Understanding how to safely handle user input without causing errors
- Working with string indexing and remembering Python uses zero-based indexing
- Prime number logic and deciding the correct range to loop over

## How I Worked Through These Challenges
- Breaking problems into smaller steps
- Printing values to understand what the code was doing
- Rewriting solutions in a simpler way before optimising
- Reusing previously written functions to avoid duplication

## Useful Resources
- Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/
- W3Schools Python tutorials
- Practice exercises provided during training

## Additional Practice
- Writing small functions and testing them with different inputs
- Refactoring working code to make it clearer and more readable
